The Worse hotel in Chengdu right now, check out at 12.30pm and they want you to pay extra half day room charges, the room key are program till 11am and you cannot open the room door after 11am though they put check out 12pm.Those staff working at the front desk are the worse atittude I encountered . Please think again if you want to stay in this hotel.
